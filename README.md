## `Data Description`
____
In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.

### File and Data Field Descriptions
**train.csv** - Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.

- **`PassengerId`** - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form `gggg_pp` where `gggg` indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and `pp` is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
- **`HomePlanet`** - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
- **`CryoSleep`** - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
- **`Cabin`** - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form `deck/num/side`, where `side` can be either `P` for Port or `S` for Starboard.
- **`Destination`** - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
- **`Age`** - The age of the passenger.
- **`VIP`** - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
- **`RoomService`**, **`FoodCourt`**, **`ShoppingMall`**, **`Spa`**, **`VRDeck`** - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
- **`Name`** - The first and last names of the passenger.
- **`Transported`** - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.
